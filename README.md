# 🚀 To-Do List Super App

![Project Banner](screenshot/app.png)

## 👋 Introduction

Hi there! I am **Faizal Richi Candra**.

This repository contains my submission for the **Mini Project: Coding Camp - Software Engineering by RevoU (Batch January 5, 2026)**. 

I designed this **To-Do List Super App** not just to fulfill a requirement, but to create a genuinely useful tool that helps users organize their daily lives, track progress, and boost productivity. Built with modern web technologies, it focuses on a clean User Experience (UX) and robust functionality.

## ✨ Key Features

This isn't just a standard list; it comes packed with "Super" features:

### 1. 📊 Smart Dashboard
- **Real-time Statistics:** Instantly view Total Tasks, Completed, and Pending items.
- **Visual Progress:** A dynamic progress bar and percentage indicator update automatically as you check off items, giving you a sense of accomplishment.

### 2. 🗂️ Advanced Task Management (Parent & Subtasks)
- **Subtask System:** Break down big goals into smaller, manageable subtasks.
- **Smart Validation:** - *Dependency Logic:* You cannot mark a main task as "Completed" if its subtasks are still pending. This ensures 100% completion of activities.
  - *Duplicate Prevention:* The app warns you if you try to add a duplicate subtask, preventing clutter.

### 3. 🔍 Search, Sort, & Filter
- **Global Search:** Find any task instantly using the search bar.
- **Sorting:** Organize tasks by Newest, Oldest, A-Z, or Z-A.
- **Filtering:** Focus on what matters by viewing All, Pending, or Completed tasks separately.

### 4. 💾 Data Persistence
- **Local Storage:** Your data is safe! The app saves your tasks automatically to your browser's local storage, so you won't lose your list even if you refresh or close the page.

### 5. 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Smooth animations when adding, deleting, or expanding tasks.
- **Edit Capability:** Made a mistake? You can easily edit task names and due dates via a modal popup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built using pure vanilla web technologies to demonstrate a strong understanding of the fundamentals:

* **HTML5** - Semantic structure.
* **CSS3** - Flexbox, Grid, and Custom Properties for styling (No external CSS frameworks used).
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** - DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, and LocalStorage logic.
* **FontAwesome** - For intuitive iconography.
* **Google Fonts** - Using 'Poppins' for a clean typography.
